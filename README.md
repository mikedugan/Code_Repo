Code_Repo
=========

It is what it says. A code repository. Most of the stuffs I write will be web/linux snippets, as you can already see.

##Intro##

This is a pretty simple idea...collect useful snippets of code, and make them available in a repository for other designers and developers to use.

###Down The Road###
Ultimately, I would like to create some sort of graphical interface for managing the code snippets. For now, vim it is!.

Sooner or later (probably sooner), I format these as Sublime Text plugins and split them into separate (Sublime & plain text) directories.

For now, feel free to fork & pull or simply drop me a line and I will add you to the contribs list.

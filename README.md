Code_Repo
=========

It is what it says. A code repository. Most of the stuffs I write will be web/linux snippets, as you can already see.

##Intro##

This is a pretty simple idea...collect useful snippets of code, and make them available in a repository for other designers and developers to use.

###Notes###
Everything is currently housed in plain_snippets directory. As soon as I find time (or someone with enough scripting experience) to migrate them to Sublime snippets, it will be done!

The directories are primarily language based. Between the html and css directories, identical file names mean they should be used together. 

In the other directories, there may be *some* integration of different languages if it is short and pertains directly to the snippet itself (ie usage example)

###Down The Road###
Ultimately, I would like to create some sort of graphical interface for managing the code snippets. For now, vim it is!.

Sooner or later (probably sooner), I format these as Sublime Text plugins and split them into separate (Sublime & plain text) directories.

For now, feel free to fork & pull or simply drop me a line and I will add you to the contribs list.
